        <p>
          Argentina vs Brazil: The victory was sealed courtesy a goal by Angel
          Di Maria in the 22nd minute of the match. The PSG forward beat the off
          side trap to receive a long floater from the mid-field on the right
          flank and then chipped the ball into the net to perfection over the
          Brazilian goal-keeper Ederson.
